# simple-pipeline

This project is designed to increase my understanding of how a data pipeline should be structured and implemented. I am using the guidelines and free templates provided by Joseph Machado in his [project](https://www.startdataengineering.com/post/data-engineering-projects-with-free-template/) as a foundation for this project.
